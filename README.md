# 🌟 DearBody-Wellness-Hub: My Personal Fitness Side Project! 🌟

Hey there! 👋 I'm excited to share a project I’ve been building for my own health journey—a clean, all-in-one wellness tracker powered by Python and Streamlit. Think of it as a friendly dashboard that keeps all your fitness stats in one place.

I got tired of jumping between different apps, so I built this hub to manage the things that matter most: tracking my habits, planning my fasting, and knowing exactly what's in my food.

## 🚀 Check It Out Live!

I’ve got the app deployed and running smoothly thanks to Streamlit Cloud. You can see it in action right now:

## 💡 What's Inside This Little Hub?

This app is built around making daily wellness decisions easier and clearer. Here's a look at the main features:

* **📏 BMI & Calorie Tool:** Quickly check your BMI and estimate the calories you burn for common activities. No more guessing games!
* **💧 Water & Habit Tracker:** Simple tools to keep those key daily habits (like drinking enough water!) consistent.
* **⏲️ Intermittent Fasting Planner:** A dedicated area to manage your fasting windows and help you stick to your schedule.
* **🍎 "Junk to Healthy" Swaps:** My favorite feature! A quick reference guide to swap out those tempting snacks for genuinely healthy alternatives.
* **💾 Session Logger:** You can easily log your daily stats (weight, mood, workout details) and download the records as a CSV file for your own tracking.

## 🛠️ Want to Run This on Your Machine?
